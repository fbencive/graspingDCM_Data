# graspingDCM_Data
Here, we loaded functional preprocessed data used for the study "Assessing the effective connectivity of premotor areas during real vs imagined grasping: a DCM-PEB approach". Uploaded files are surface data relative to the left hemisphere. A file with the onset and the duration of each block is available (Trials.xlsx). Finally, we made available probabilistic surface ROIs of the brain regions included in our DCM analysis.
